# geti2p64

fetch an i2p base64 with a SAM lookup at the terminal, doing as little else as
possible. Sometimes you just need to do one thing.

to install it, use:

        go get -u github.com/eyedeekay/geti2p64/lookup

and run

        $GOPATH/bin/geti2p64 fiftytwocharacteri2pbasethirtytwoaddressesarelongeh.b32.i2p

for example. Obviously that's not a real address.
